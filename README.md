# Peptide-ligands-binding-protocol
For all the systems: 
- Y4R-SRS-Gi
- Y4R-RSR-Gi
- Y4R-hPP-Gi
- Y1R-pNPY-Gi
- Y2R-pNPY-Gi
- V2R-AVP-Gs
- OTR-OT-Gq
starting structures, global and secondary minima structures are provided as pdb files (protein coordinates).


For the Y4R-SRS-Gi system, plumed input file to run MW-MetaD with binding/unbinding CV is provided (plumed.dat). 
32 representative structures of the Y4R-SRS-Gi system were extracted from a short MetaD to initialise each walker. The system coordinates are provided as pdb files.
